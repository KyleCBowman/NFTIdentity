# IAMX X NFT MAKER X SELENE SYSTEMS IDENTIFICATION Specification Draft v0.1

# Overview

This is a draft document

# Explanation

Before we attempt to explain how this will solve identity for the prupose of verifying NFTs, we need to first look at how it solves the identity problem for people businesses


# Getting onboarded


* First point
* Second Point
* Third point


# Key principles
* Public Key Encyption
* One-Way Processes
* Conceptually similar to SSL Certificate Authorities



# There are 3 scenarios in which we would need to implement this

* Brand New Project, Yet to mint and with an Open Policy
* A project that has already minted, but does have an Open Policy
* A project that has already minted and the Policy has closed


## New Projects
As with all new standards, they tend to be easiest to implement on new instances.
In this case, all new projects have the option to set this up in the optimal format, whereby the DID is included inside of each NFT.
Crucially, this NFT will be signed by a trusted party such as NFT Maker or IAMX.

## Minted, with currently Open Policy
With the PolicyID still open, we are able to mint another NFT under that Policy and gain the inherint proof of authenticity through it.
We can therefore use this opportunity to mint a single new NFT containing the DID information for that collection.
Crucially, this NFT will be signed by a trusted party such as NFT Maker or IAMX.

## Minted, with a Closed Policy
In this case (as will be for many projects by now) the Policy is already closed.
This gives us more of a challenge as we can no longer point from inside the project, rather from the outside in.
To solve this, our solution wiuld be for the creator to maintain another Policy, specifically for the purpose of pointing
